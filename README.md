# Form Validation Website

A simple website that demonstrates form validation using JavaScript and Regular Expressions (Regex). This project validates various form inputs like name, email, phone number, and other common fields.

## Features

- **Real-time validation**: Form fields are validated as the user types or submits.
- **Custom validation rules**: Built using JavaScript and Regular Expressions to ensure data correctness.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is mobile-friendly and adapts to various screen sizes.
- **User feedback**: Clear messages are shown to users if the input is invalid.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure of the website
- **CSS3** - Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** - Core logic for form validation
- **Regex** - Used for custom validation patterns 

## How It Works

- The form inputs are validated using JavaScript on the `submit` event or on user input.
- Regular Expressions (Regex) are used to match patterns like email addresses, phone numbers, etc.
- If any field is invalid, an error message is shown, and the form won't be submitted until all fields are valid.

## Validation Examples

- **Email**: Must be a valid email format (e.g., `example@gmail.com`).
- **Phone Number**: Must Contains only 10 digits 
- *Name*: Only contains Alphabets
